variables:

boxesContainer ('boxes')
btn ('btn')

---

add a click to btn in order to toggle '.big' ((use arrow function))

"createBoxes" function

for loop > for loop

hint: iterators (i & j) less than "4"

variable "box" create an element of 'div'

add class of .box to that variable

background position for the box - temperate literal - ${negative iterators multiplied by 125} px each

i suspect that has to do with sides/dimensions
